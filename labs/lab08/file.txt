In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data
in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications,
and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly
well-suited for implementation of databases, while compiler implementations usually use hash
tables to look up identifiers.
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently, such as
large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures
are a key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages
emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design.
Storing and retrieving can be carried out on data stored in both main memory and in secondary memory.
